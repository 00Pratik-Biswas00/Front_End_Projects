As we are instructed not to use any third-party libraries, the extra dependency that I used is react-router-dom, and for styling, I used tailwind CSS.

#### Sections that can be improved further:

1. For the Phone number part, you can use `npm i react-phone-number-input` to get the country codes.
2. For the Country and city parts, you can use `npm i country-state-city` to get detailed names.
