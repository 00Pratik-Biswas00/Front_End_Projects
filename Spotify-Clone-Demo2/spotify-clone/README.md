## Getting Started with Cloning the Repo

1. Download the zip file.
1. Open it in your VS code. 

## Go the project directory

### 1. `cd Spotify-Clone-Demo2`

### 2. `cd spotify-clone`

### 3. To install the dependencies: `npm i`

### 4. To run the website `npm run dev`

In the terminal paste this ->

1. `npm install -D tailwindcss`
2. `npx tailwindcss init`

Then go to the tailwind.config.js file and make the changes ->

```
content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
```

Now go to the index.css file and update it with this ->

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
